# Template Alignment Skill

Generic two-way alignment between two related projects. Determine source and target, compare structures and content, then migrate changes.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish context

Before making changes, resolve these:

| Question | How to determine |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Source** | Which project has the "correct" state? Ask if ambiguous. "Align with X" means source = X. |
| **Target** | The project receiving updates. Default to active editor's project. |
| **Direction** | Source -> Target. Ask if unclear. |
| **Root paths** | Resolve absolute paths for both projects. |

### 2. Compare project structure

Run `find` on both roots (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, `output`, `package-lock.json`) and categorize:

- **Missing in target** (exists in source only) — candidates to create
- **Extra in target** (exists in target only) — project-specific; ask before deleting
- **Shared** (exists in both) — needs content diff

### 3. Diff shared files

Run `diff` on each shared file. Focus analysis on these high-level topics:

| Topic | What to check |
|-------|---------------|
| **Architecture** | Code style patterns (`const` vs `var`, arrow vs function), module system (guards, exports), inline vs external assets |
| **Configuration** | `.gitignore` entries, `package.json` scripts and deps, CI workflow steps and env vars |
| **Build pipeline** | Build script structure, variable naming conventions, utility functions, post-build hooks |
| **Tooling** | Hook scripts (validation approach), linting, formatting |
| **Documentation** | Project docs (`AGENTS.md`), section structure, references |
| **Public assets** | HTML/CSS/JS files — architecture approach, code style, feature completeness |

For each diff, determine if source's version is the "better" one to port, or if both sides have independent changes that should merge.

### 4. Resolve conflicts

When source and target differ on the same feature or styling, use this hierarchy:

1. **Try to merge** — if both sides have meaningful independent changes, combine them. Example: source has a new CSS variable block, target has a different color palette — keep both by scoping or integrating.
2. **Source wins** — if merging produces broken code, ambiguous intent, or conflicting approaches to the same feature, discard the target version and adopt source's version entirely. This is the default fallback.
3. **Ask only when unclear** — if it's genuinely impossible to determine which approach is correct (e.g., environment-specific paths, credentials, platform-specific config), ask the user. Do not ask for every trivial difference.

**Conflict resolution examples:**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Same CSS class, different properties | Merge: combine unique properties; source wins on overlap |
| Same function, different implementation | Source wins (replace entire function) |
| Same config key, different value | Source wins |
| Target has something source lacks entirely | Keep it unless it conflicts with source's approach |
| Both add different new features to same area | Merge both if compatible; source wins on collision |

### 5. Apply migration

Apply the identified changes to the target project.

### 6. Verify

Run appropriate checks based on target's stack (syntax checks, build, output listing).
